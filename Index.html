    <p> Snakes are the most specialized group of reptiles. Many species of snake are found all over the world. Some of which are
    poisonous while some are not poisonous. Among poisonous snakes, Inland is considered the most poisonous and is very
    dangerous. There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they are found everywhere except in Antarctica, Iceland,
    Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. About 600 species are venomous, and only about 200—seven percent—are able to kill
    or significantly wound a human. Snakes do not smell through their nostrils but their tongues. Snakes detect the surrounding environment with their
    tongues. Another important fact related to snakes is that only 70% of species of snakes lay eggs, the remaining 30% of
    species produce children. </p>
